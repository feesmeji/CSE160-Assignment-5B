    <p>UCSC Email: feesmeji@ucsc.edu</p>
    
    <p>Notes to grader: Most code based off of threejs.org guides that were linked on assignment 5.A instructions. ChatGPT sometimes helped me debug and get unstuck with my code, and I made comments in my code indicating where it was used. Also recieved help from a course tutor.
